# stylelint.io

The source of stylelint website. Uses the same tech stack as the [postcss.org repo](https://github.com/postcss/postcss.org).

To get started:

```shell
npm install
```

Then to making visual edits:

```shell
npm start
```

Or to update the website to the latest version of stylelint:

```shell
npm install --save-dev stylelint@latest
npm run deploy
```

... then commit and push your dependency change.
